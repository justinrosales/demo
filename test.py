print("Hello World! I am still trying to figure out how to connect VS Code to Github")

# when I send a push request it doesn't update on github for some reason
# IT FINALLY WORKED

# 9/26/22 - hmmm.. when I try do git push -u origin master, it doesn't update on github
# on the terminal it says "Everything up-to-date" even though that is not the case :/
